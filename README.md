# ChatRoom (https://web-chat-angular.herokuapp.com)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://boiling-plains-77861.herokuapp.com/ for the application to make requests against.

#### If you want to change the SERVER URL to a local server;  
Simply edit src/environments/environment.ts and change server_url to the local server's URL (i.e. localhost:4200).  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
